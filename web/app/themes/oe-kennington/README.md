# The Maat Theme

Maat is an introduction to WordPress Themes and Nodejs workflows.
The theme is inspried by several speakers at the *WordCamp in Aarhus 2016*. 
They mentioned tools such as SASS, Bower, Grunt and Eslint. 

* SASS 
* Bower

The theme includes several libraries, such as:

* Bootstrap
* Jquery

The Bower files are ignored via .gitignore. Install them this way:

~~~~
# 1) Install Nodejs depencencies
npm install

# 2) Install Bower dependencies
bower install
~~~~

## Idea

The general idea is to create a basic skeleton files for further theme developments.
