## About oe-kennington theme
This theme it is a fork of [Maat theme repo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asathoor/maat-or-the-improved-bootstrap) and customized for our own needs.


# The Maat Theme

Maat is an introduction to WordPress Themes and Nodejs workflows.
The theme is inspried by several speakers at the *WordCamp in Aarhus 2016*.
They mentioned tools such as SASS, Bower, Grunt and Eslint.

* SASS
* Bower

The theme includes several libraries, such as:

* Bootstrap
* Jquery

The Bower files are ignored via .gitignore. Install them this way:

~~~~
# 1) Install Nodejs depencencies
npm install

# 2) Install Bower dependencies
bower install
~~~~

## Idea

The general idea is to create a basic skeleton files for further theme developments.
